Welcome to my world, the world of programmers, or the world of lonely people!

欢迎来到我的世界，程序员的世界，或者是一个孤独者的世界！

Life is always very confusing, sometimes I don't know what to do. Although I have always been a programmer,
But I don't know what the program can bring me, can it help me achieve financial freedom,
There are more goals that I don't know now and may not know in the future.
Now, I have an idea that I want to express my thinking, understanding, and expression.
Perhaps, in this way, I won't feel lost or confused anymore

人生都是很迷茫的，有时候我都不知要去干嘛，我虽然一直做程序员，
但我不知道程序能为我带来什么，能否帮我实现财务自由，
还有更多的目标，现在我不知道，可能将来也不知道。
现在，我有一个想法，我要把我的思考，认识，表现出来。
或许，这样，我就不会感受到迷茫困惑了
